Hello, everyone!

This was the first time I created a portfolio web and used GitHub Pages to help to see the final result. <br>
It is so nice to see my first steps. <br>
At the moment I created this repository, I was studying Introduction to HTML and CSS. <br>
I am sure that in the future, when I look back to this moment, I will feel proud of my first small job :) <br>
